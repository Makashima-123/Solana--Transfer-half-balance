# Solana: Transfer 50% balance 
 It generates two keypairs, one for the sender and one for the receiver, establishes a connection to the devnet Solana cluster, requests an airdrop of SOL tokens to the sender wallet, waits for confirmation, transfers half of the sender's balance to the receiver, and outputs the sender and receiver wallet balances before and after the transaction.
